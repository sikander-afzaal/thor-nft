      <p>
        Combining gaming with blockchain technology, it's now possible to
        provide a way for gamers to be rewarded for doing what they love,
        playing games.

            With Decentralized Finance, we can leverage blockchain ran economy
            models. This creates community ran economies where players can earn
            tokens while they play. The community also holds power with Gods of
            Asgard, with the ability to vote on future updates and improvements.

          <h2>Ownership</h2>
          <p>
            Using Blockchain technology, players can own their characters and
            other in-game assets. In traditional gaming, developers of the game
            own and control all assets. Players are free to sell, purchase, and
            trade the blockchain assets including character NFTs and tokens
            earned.
